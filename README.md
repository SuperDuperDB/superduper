## Introduction

This proposal outlines the development of a user interface prototype for managing datastores, defining models, and applying machine learning models to data using FastAPI, React JS, and a MongoDB datastore. The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with data, define machine learning models, and apply those models to selected data.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a prototype that demonstrates the following functionalities:

1. **User Interface**: Creating a web-based user interface using React or similar technologies that enables users to interact with the application.

2. **Model Definition**: Developing a FastAPI backend that allows users to define machine learning models, including integration with OpenAI and Hugging-Face (transformers) models.

3. **Datastore Integration**: Implementing connectivity to a MongoDB datastore for storing and retrieving data.

4. **Configuration Management**: Designing a configuration file system that defines available datastores, models, and options.

5. **Data Manipulation**: Enabling users to choose a datastore, select a collection, define or upload machine learning models, and specify data queries for model application.

6. **Progress Display (Stretch Goal)**: Implementing a dialog window in the frontend to display the progress of computations performed by the backend.

## Scope

The scope of this project is to create a functional prototype that demonstrates the core functionalities mentioned above. The prototype will not only include advanced features, such as user authentication, extensive error handling, or production-level optimizations. Its primary purpose is to serve as a proof of concept and a foundation for future development.

## Implementation Plan

### Technologies

The proposed technologies for the implementation of this prototype are as follows:

- **Frontend**: React JS or a similar web framework for building the user interface.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs.
- **Database**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Configuration**: YAML files for defining datastores, models, and options.

### Components

The prototype will consist of the following components:

1. **User Interface (React)**:
   - A web-based interface for user interaction.
   - Views and forms for choosing datastores, collections, defining/uploading models, and specifying data queries.
   - Model Definition: Users can define or upload machine learning models. The prototype will support both OpenAI and Transformers models.

   - Query Definition: Users can define queries to specify which data the model should be applied to using the ``model.predict`` function.

    - (Stretch Goal) Listening for Progress: Implementing a dialog window that displays the progress of computations from the backend in real-time.

2. **FastAPI Backend**:
   - API endpoints for model definition and data manipulation.
   - Integration with OpenAI and Hugging-Face models.
   - Integration with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
   - Model Definition Endpoint: Creation of an endpoint that allows users to define machine learning models. This endpoint will support both OpenAI models and Hugging-Face Transformers models.

3. **MongoDB Datastore**:
   - A NoSQL database for storing data and configuration information and to facilitate faster data retrieval.

4. **Configuration Files**:
   - YAML files defining available datastores, models, and user options.

### Functionality

The prototype will provide the following core functionalities:

- User login and registration (if required for future development).
- Choosing a datastore from the available options.
- Selecting a collection within the chosen datastore.
- Defining or uploading machine learning models (OpenAI or transformers).
- Specifying data queries for applying the models.
- Progress display for model computations (stretch goal).

## Stretch Goals

As a stretch goal, I aim to implement a dialog window in the frontend to display the progress of computations performed by the backend. This will enhance the user experience by providing real-time feedback on long-running operations.

## Deliverables
The deliverables for this project include:

- A fully functional user interface prototype with a React JS frontend.
- A FastAPI backend that supports model definition, data interaction, and MongoDB integration.
- A configuration file defining available datastores, models, and options.
- Documentation for usage and integration, including information on model definition.
- (Stretch Goal) Real-time progress updates displayed in a dialog window.
## Timeline
The proposed timeline for this project is as follows:

- Week 1: Frontend Development
- Week 2: Backend Development
- Week 3: Integration with MongoDB
- Week 3: Configuration File Implementation
- Week 4: Documentation and Testing
- Week 4: Finalize Stretch Goal (Real-time Progress Updates)
- Week 5: Code Review and Quality Assurance
- Week 5: Deployment and User Testing
