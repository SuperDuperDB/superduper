## Introduction

This proposal outlines the development of a user interface prototype for managing datastores, defining models, and applying machine learning models to data using FastAPI, React JS, and a MongoDB datastore. The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with data, define machine learning models, and apply those models to selected data.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a prototype that demonstrates the following functionalities:

1. **User Interface**: Creating a web-based user interface using React or similar technologies that enables users to interact with the application.

2. **Model Definition**: Developing a FastAPI backend that allows users to define machine learning models, including integration with OpenAI and Hugging-Face (transformers) models.

3. **Datastore Integration**: Implementing connectivity to a MongoDB datastore for storing and retrieving data.

4. **Configuration Management**: Designing a configuration file system that defines available datastores, models, and options.

5. **Data Manipulation**: Enabling users to choose a datastore, select a collection, define or upload machine learning models, and specify data queries for model application.

6. **Progress Display (Stretch Goal)**: Implementing a dialog window in the frontend to display the progress of computations performed by the backend.

## Scope

The scope of this project is to create a functional prototype that demonstrates the core functionalities mentioned above. The prototype will not include advanced features, such as user authentication, extensive error handling, or production-level optimizations. Its primary purpose is to serve as a proof of concept and a foundation for future development.

## Implementation Plan

### Technologies

The proposed technologies for the implementation of this prototype are as follows:

- **Frontend**: React JS or a similar web framework for building the user interface.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs.
- **Database**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Configuration**: YAML files for defining datastores, models, and options.

### Components

The prototype will consist of the following components:

1. **User Interface (React)**:
   - A web-based interface for user interaction.
   - Views and forms for choosing datastores, collections, defining/uploading models, and specifying data queries.

2. **FastAPI Backend**:
   - API endpoints for model definition and data manipulation.
   - Integration with OpenAI and Hugging-Face models.
   - Integration with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.

3. **MongoDB Datastore**:
   - A NoSQL database for storing data and configuration information.

4. **Configuration Files**:
   - YAML files defining available datastores, models, and options.

### Functionality

The prototype will provide the following core functionalities:

- User login and registration (if required for future development).
- Choosing a datastore from the available options.
- Selecting a collection within the chosen datastore.
- Defining or uploading machine learning models (OpenAI or transformers).
- Specifying data queries for applying the models.
- Progress display for model computations (stretch goal).

## Stretch Goals

As a stretch goal, I aim to implement a dialog window in the frontend to display the progress of computations performed by the backend. This will enhance the user experience by providing real-time feedback on long-running operations.

## Resources

To aid in the development of this prototype, the following resources will be used:

- Model documentation: [https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/usage/models](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/usage/models)
- Source code of OpenAI model (dataclass): [https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduperdb/blob/main/superduperdb/ext/openai/model.py](https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduperdb/blob/main/superduperdb/ext/openai/model.py)
- Source code of transformers model: [https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduperdb/blob/main/superduperdb/ext/transformers/model.py](https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduperdb/blob/main/superduperdb/ext/transformers/model.py)

This proposal outlines the plan for creating a user interface prototype that will demonstrate the core functionality of the system. Once approved, I will proceed with the development and provide regular updates on the progress.
