# Configuring models to ingest features from other models

There are two ways to connect models in `superduperdb`:

- via interdependent `Listeners`

In both cases, the first step is define the computation graph using 
a simple formalism.

## Building a computation graph

`superduperdb` supports directly acyclic graphs:
